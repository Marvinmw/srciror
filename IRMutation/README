Instructions for compiling the LLVM passes:

- copy the directory called Mutation (under LLVMPasses) as is into the
  LLVM source code tree under lib/Transforms/
- add our new mutation pass (Mutation) into the make files under lib/Transforms.
(either copy the provided Makefile and CMakeLists.txt into lib/Transforms
if using LLVM 3.8.1 or adapt the existing ones if using another version)
- go to your LLVM build directory and rebuild. You should have the mutation
library generated under $build_directory/Release+Asserts/lib/LLVMMutate.so
